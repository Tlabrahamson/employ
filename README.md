# Employ

I've decided to redesign this project. It is a work in progress.

Live site -> https://jr-dev-sim.netlify.app/

Built with:

- MongoDB Atlas 
- Express and Node
- Mongoose
- React
- Styled Components
- Material-UI
- Axios

Jr Dev Sim allows for CRUD operations. You can only see and apply for jobs if you aren't logged in. If you ARE logged in, you can create a job listing, update an existing job listing, and delete a job listing.
